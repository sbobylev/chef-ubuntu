Installs and configures Ubuntu desktop the way I like. The cookbooks and recipes are optiomized for Ubuntu 16.04. Ideally, it should be ran on a newly installed system. Use it on your own risk.

1. Install git

```sudo apt install git```
2. Run the installer as a regular user. You'll be prompted to enter sudoers password during the install process. 

```bash install.sh```
